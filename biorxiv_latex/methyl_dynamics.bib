@article{Jang1999,
abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA repair gene PHR1 encodes a photolyase that catalyzes the light-dependent repair of pyrimidine dimers. PHR1 expression is induced at the level of transcription by a variety of DNA-damaging agents. The primary regulator of the PHR1 damage response is a 39-bp sequence called URS PHR1 which is the binding site for a protein(s) that constitutes the damage-responsive repressor PRP. In this communication, we report the identification of two proteins, Rph1p and Gis1p, that regulate PHR1 expression through URS PHR1 . Both proteins contain two putative zinc fingers that are identical throughout the DNA binding region, and deletion of both RPH1 and GIS1 is required to fully derepress PHR1 in the absence of damage. Derepression of PHR1 increases the rate and extent of photoreactivation in vivo, demonstrating that the damage response of PHR1 enhances cellular repair capacity. In vitro footprinting and binding competition studies indicate that the sequence AG 4 (C 4 T) within URS PHR1 is the binding site for Rph1p and Gis1p and suggests that at least one additional DNA binding component is present in the PRP complex.},

@article{Chang2011,
abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevesiae Rph1 is a histone demethylase orthologous to human JMJD2A (Jumonji-domain-containing protein 2A) that can specifically demethylate tri- and di-methylated Lys36 of histone H3. c-Rph1, the catalytic core of Rph1, is responsible for the demethylase activity, which is essential for the transcription elongation of some actively transcribed genes. In the present work, we report the crystal structures of c-Rph1 in apo form and in complex with Ni2+ and $\alpha$-KG [2-oxoglutarate ($\alpha$-ketoglutarate)]. The structure of c-Rph1 is composed of a JmjN (Jumonji N) domain, a long $\beta$-hairpin, a mixed structural motif and a JmjC domain. The $\alpha$-KG cofactor forms hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chains of conserved residues, and the Ni2+ ion at the active site is chelated by conserved residues and the cofactor. Structural comparison of Rph1 with JMJD2A indicates that the substrate-binding cleft of Rph1 is formed with several structural elements of the JmjC domain, the long $\beta$-hairpin and the mixed structural motif; and the methylated Lys36 of H3 is recognized by several conserved residues of the JmjC domain. In vitro biochemical results show that mutations of the key residues at the catalytic centre and in the substrate-binding cleft abolish the demethylase activity. In vivo growth phenotype analyses also demonstrate that these residues are essential for its functional roles in transcription elongation. Taken together, our structural and biological data provide insights into the molecular basis of the histone demethylase activity and the substrate specificity of Rph1.},
